## 📊 UNDERSTANDING THE 6 INDICATORS

### 1️⃣ **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** - 14 Period
```
What it shows:
- Overbought (top area): Price might pull back down
- Oversold (bottom area): Price might bounce up
- Range: 0 to 100

Good values:
- Above 70 = Overbought (potential SELL signal)
- Below 30 = Oversold (potential BUY signal)
```

### 2️⃣ **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** - 12/26/9
```
What it shows:
- Momentum and trend changes
- Fast MACD crossing Slow MACD = signal generation
- Shows "divergences" (price moves different than MACD)

Good signals:
- MACD above signal line = Bullish
- MACD below signal line = Bearish
```

### 3️⃣ **Bollinger Bands** - 20 Period, 2 Standard Deviations
```
What it shows:
- Upper band = resistance (price might bounce down)
- Middle line = average (trend direction)
- Lower band = support (price might bounce up)

Usage:
- Price touching upper band = overbought
- Price touching lower band = oversold
- Wide bands = high volatility
- Narrow bands = low volatility
```

### 4️⃣ **ADX (Average Directional Index)** - 14 Period
```
What it shows:
- Trend strength (how strong is the current trend?)
- Range: 0 to 100

Interpretation:
- Below 20 = Weak or no trend (avoid trading)
- 20-40 = Moderate trend (good trading signals)
- Above 40 = Strong trend (very reliable signals)
```

### 5️⃣ **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** - 20 Period
```
What it shows:
- Green line on chart showing trend direction
- Recent prices weighted more heavily

Usage:
- Price above EMA = Uptrend (Bullish)
- Price below EMA = Downtrend (Bearish)
- EMA crossing = Potential trend change
```

### 6️⃣ **Volume Analysis**
```
What it shows:
- Trading volume confirmation
- High volume = Strong signal
- Low volume = Weak signal

Usage:
- Buy signals with high volume = more reliable
- Sell signals with high volume = more reliable
```

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR TRADING

### ✅ DO:
```
✓ Use 1h to 4h timeframes (most reliable)

```

### ❌ DON'T:
```

✗ Trade on 1m-5m timeframes (too much noise)
✗ Risk more than 2% per trade
✗ Trade during high volatility/uncertainty
✗ Overtrade (wait for high-probability setups)
```
